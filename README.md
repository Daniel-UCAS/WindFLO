# WindFLO - A Framework for fast Wind Farm Layout Optimization




The WindFLO model incorporates the following advancements:

* Local terrain elevation is modeled.
* The atmospheric wind velocity is modeled using the Log-Law and the Power-Law.
* Six different analytical wake models are available
* Four different wake merging schemes are available
* The properties of each turbine (diameter, height, power curve, etc.) can be different. 
* Each turbine can use a different wake model and wake superposition scheme.
* Partial influence of the wake on a turbine is also considered.
* Rotor diameter and tower height dependent cost models are available.
* Wind farm area is computed as the area of convex hull.
